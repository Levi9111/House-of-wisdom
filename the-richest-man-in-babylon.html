            <p>"A part of all I earn is mine to keep." This is the foundational rule that made a poor scribe the wealthiest man in Babylon. First published in 1926, George S. Clason's timeless classic uses parables set 4,000 years ago to reveal financial principles as unchanging as the laws of gravity[citation:1][citation:6]. The book has sold over 2 million copies and remains a cornerstone of personal financial advice[citation:7].</p>
            <p>At its height, Babylon was the wealthiest city in the world because its citizens understood money[citation:1]. This is the wisdom of Arkad, shared to cure a lean purse and teach gold to labor diligently for its owner[citation:6][citation:10].</p>

They crush the spirit of procrastination, for "no man can arrive at the fullest measure of success until he does so."[citation:10]</p>

                                <p>Invest in what you understand. Avoid ventures where you cannot judge the risk. This is the law against following uninformed "tips"[citation:1].</p>

                                <p>Greed is the great destroyer of wealth. Chasing unrealistic returns or falling for scams will empty your purse faster than anything[citation:1].</p>

                            <p class="p-text">True luck is the marriage of <strong>preparation</strong> (saving, gaining wisdom) and <strong>action</strong> (seizing the right moment).
