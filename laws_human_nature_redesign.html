<div class="laws">
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 1</div>
        <div class="law-title">Master Your Emotional Self</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Rationality We All Envy: Understand your own emotions and learn to control them. Our emotions evolved to compel us to act quickly, but in the modern world they often lead us astray. Recognize the biases and distortions that emotions create, and develop the ability to step back and observe yourself as if from a distance.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 2</div>
        <div class="law-title">Transform Self-Love into Empathy</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Empathic Operation: See things from other people's perspective. We are naturally self-absorbed, seeing the world through our own needs and desires. Practice seeing events through others' eyes, understanding their motivations, fears, and desires. This allows you to connect with people on a deeper level and influence them more effectively.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 3</div>
        <div class="law-title">See Through People's Masks</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Deciphering of Character: People wear masks to hide their true selves. Learn to read nonverbal cues, patterns of behavior, and subtle inconsistencies between what people say and do. Pay attention to what people reveal when they're under stress or caught off guard.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 4</div>
        <div class="law-title">Determine the Strength of People's Character</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Reality Filter: Assess people's character through their actions, not their words. Look for signs of resilience, consistency, and integrity. People with strong character can handle adversity and stay true to their values, while those with weak character will crumble under pressure or betray their principles.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 5</div>
        <div class="law-title">Become Aware of the Driving Force of Envy</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Envious Gaze: Recognize envy in yourself and others. Envy is a powerful but often hidden emotion that drives much human behavior. It stems from feelings of inferiority and the desire to possess what others have. Learn to detect envy in its subtle forms and protect yourself from its destructive effects.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 6</div>
        <div class="law-title">Elevate Your Perspective Above the Moment</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Sublime Perspective: Develop a long-term perspective. Most people are trapped in the present moment, reacting impulsively to events. Cultivate the ability to step back and see the larger patterns, historical context, and future implications of your actions and decisions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 7</div>
        <div class="law-title">Soften People's Resistance by Confirming Their Self-Opinion</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Persuasive Mirror: Make people feel understood and validated. Everyone has a self-opinion—how they see themselves. By reflecting back to people the positive aspects of their self-image, you lower their resistance and make them more receptive to your influence.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 8</div>
        <div class="law-title">Change Your Circumstances by Changing Your Attitude</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Alchemy of Attitude: Your attitude shapes your reality. A negative, fearful, or resentful attitude will attract negative experiences. Cultivate a positive, resilient, and expansive attitude that sees possibilities rather than limitations, and watch your circumstances transform.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 9</div>
        <div class="law-title">Confront Your Dark Side</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Shadow Integration: Acknowledge and integrate your darker impulses. Everyone has a shadow self—unconscious desires, repressed emotions, and negative traits. By becoming aware of your shadow and consciously integrating it, you gain power over it rather than having it control you unconsciously.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 10</div>
        <div class="law-title">Beware the Fragile Ego</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Ego Radar: Recognize and avoid people with fragile egos. Fragile egos are easily bruised and will react defensively to any perceived slight. They create unnecessary drama and conflict. Learn to identify the signs of ego fragility and protect yourself from their toxic reactions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 11</div>
        <div class="law-title">Know Your Limits</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Grandiosity Antidote: Understand your natural limitations. Human nature includes the tendency toward grandiosity—overestimating our abilities and control. Develop realistic self-awareness about your strengths and weaknesses, and work within your natural limitations rather than fighting against them.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 12</div>
        <div class="law-title">Reconnect to the Masculine or Feminine Within You</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Gender Transcendence: Integrate both masculine and feminine qualities. Society encourages exaggerated gender roles, but psychological health requires balancing both masculine qualities (agency, logic, assertiveness) and feminine qualities (receptivity, intuition, empathy). Develop the side you've neglected.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 13</div>
        <div class="law-title">Advance with a Sense of Purpose</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Purpose Engine: Cultivate a deep sense of purpose. Without purpose, we drift through life reacting to external stimuli. With purpose, we move with direction and meaning. Connect your daily actions to a larger mission or vision that gives your life significance.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 14</div>
        <div class="law-title">Resist the Downward Pull of the Group</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Group Dynamics Awareness: Maintain your individuality in group settings. Groups exert powerful pressure to conform, often lowering standards of behavior and thinking. Develop the ability to think independently while still participating socially, and avoid getting swept up in groupthink or mob mentality.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 15</div>
        <div class="law-title">Make Them Want to Follow You</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Authority Magnet: Cultivate natural authority. True leadership isn't about commanding obedience but inspiring voluntary followership. Develop qualities that make people want to follow you—vision, competence, empathy, and integrity. Lead by example rather than by force.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 16</div>
        <div class="law-title">See the Hostility Behind the Friendly Façade</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Aggression Detector: Recognize hidden aggression. Some people mask their hostility with excessive friendliness, flattery, or apparent concern. Learn to detect the subtle signs of passive aggression, manipulation, and covert hostility that lie beneath pleasant exteriors.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 17</div>
        <div class="law-title">Seize the Historical Moment</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Timing Instinct: Develop a sense of historical timing. Success often depends on recognizing and acting at the right historical moment. Cultivate awareness of larger social, economic, and cultural trends, and position yourself to take advantage of emerging opportunities.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="law">
        <div class="law-number">Law 18</div>
        <div class="law-title">Meditate on Our Common Mortality</div>
        <div class="law-description">
            <p>The Mortality Mindfulness: Contemplate death to enhance life. Awareness of mortality is not morbid but liberating—it clarifies what's truly important and motivates us to live fully. Regular contemplation of death reduces pettiness, increases appreciation, and helps you focus on what matters most.</p>
